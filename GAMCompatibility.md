# GAM Compatibility Chart
#### This document outlines the compatible versions of GAM for versions of ChromebookGUI.
The ChromebookGUI version runs along the top and the GAM version runs along the left side.

'Intended version' means that you should use that version pair: you'd want to use GAM 4.6.1 with versions <0.2.7, and GAM 4.6.5 for 0.2.8. **If you're not using the intended version, you may experience some oddities when using ChromebookGUI.**

 |x | <0.2.7 | 0.2.8 |
| :-- | :-- | :--|
| 4.61 | Fully compatible (intended version) | Fully compatible
| 4.6.5 | **Not recommended** \| Some formatting issues; some items will be mislabeled, but core functionality should work | Fully compatible (intended version)
