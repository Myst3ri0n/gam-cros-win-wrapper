# GAM Compatibility Chart
#### This document outlines the compatible versions of GAM for versions of ChromebookGUI.
The ChromebookGUI version runs along the top and the GAM version runs along the left side.

'Intended version' means that you should use that version pair: you'd want to use GAM 4.6.1 with versions <0.2.7, and GAM 4.6.5 for 0.2.8. **If you're not using the intended version, you may experience some oddities when using ChromebookGUI.**

Don't worry about using a version between tests. The newest version of ChromebookGUI should almost always be paired with the newest version of GAM.

 |x | <0.2.7 | 0.2.8 | 1.0.1
| :-- | :-- | :--|
| 4.61 | Fully compatible (intended version) | Fully compatible
| 4.6.5 | **Not recommended** \| Some formatting issues; some items will be mislabeled, but core functionality should work | Fully compatible (intended version)
| 4.8.2 | n/a | ^ | Fully compatible | Fully compatible (intended version)


Have a different but working test? Please edit this file with the little pencil in the top right and submit a PR with your test. That really helps!
